7. (a) DNS - Each website is a computer(server) on a network. Each website hence has a unique address for identification 
 	     called the IP address. DNS is a naming system used for translating proper names (host names) to this rather 
 	     difficult-to-remember IP addresses. Without these easy-to-remember host names, the website cannot be accessed.

   (b) DHCP - The Dynamic Host Control Protocol as a network protocol automatically assigns IP addresses to devices 
	      connected on a network. These IP addresses are what enable the devices to communicate on a network using
	      the Internet Protocol. Without these IP addresses, no device can access websites on the internet.

   (c) Firewall - The firewall is configured or set up to block unauthorized access to or from a private network.
		  This firewall blocks unauthorized access to the website saved on the web server from hackers,
 		  viruses, worms and other harmful attacks to steal or destroy data on the webpage.


   (d) FTP - The File Transfer Protocol transfers the webpage you create on your computer to the server.
	     The server then hosts the webpage and releases it as requests for it are made by the client.
